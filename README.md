# SvelteExample

## Modifications For Svelte

Modifications were made to `config/dev.exs` to use the `esbuild-svelte` build
script (which is located in `assets/build.js`).

To start the project:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Install the Node dependencies:

  ```
  cd assets
  npm install
  ```
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix
    phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
